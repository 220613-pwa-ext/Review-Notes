--RDBS (https://www.techopedia.com/definition/1234/relational-database-rdb)
-- Relational Database System
-- Data is stored in tables - rows and tables 
-- Connects Tables together - with Foreign keys

-- Text file vs RDBS - (https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/difference-between-file-system-and-dbms/)
-- I don't need any extra dependencies or SQL knowledge to work with files. 
-- RDBS will be more organized: 
--		You would have tables and clearly see relationships between tables. 
--		Having it more organized and rigged makes queries more efficient. 
-- RDBS can handle concurrent transactions
-- 		Text file won't be handle multiple changes at the same time. 
--		RDBS have isolation levels and transaction control. 

--SQL 
-- Structured Query Language 
-- This is a domain specific programming language used to communicate 
--      with relational databases. 
-- CRUD - (Create Read Update Delete) operations on our data (DML and DQL)
-- Control Access to my database (DCL)
-- Define what data can be stored. (DDL)
-- Control Transactions on the database. (TCL)
